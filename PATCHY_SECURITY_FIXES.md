## Applied Fixes

### 1. server.js
- **Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Breaking Changes:** No


## Implementation Notes

### server.js
**Issue:** 1) We replaced plaintext password storage with bcrypt.hash() for strong, one-way hashing and bcrypt.compare() to verify credentials.  
2) We added input validation to ensure username and password are provided and handled duplicate registrations.  
3) We issue signed JWTs (jsonwebtoken) stored in HttpOnly, Secure cookies (cookie-parser) to prevent XSS from reading tokens.  
4) We introduced environment variables (dotenv) for secrets (JWT_SECRET) and token expiration (JWT_EXPIRES_IN).  
5) We provided a sample protected route (/protected) demonstrating JWT verification and error handling.

**Security Notes:** - Always run over HTTPS so Secure cookies are transmitted only on encrypted connections.  
- Rotate JWT_SECRET regularly and store it securely (e.g., in a secrets manager).  
- Use a persistent, hardened database instead of in-memory storage for production.  
- Add rate limiting and account lockout to mitigate brute-force attacks.  
- Consider CSRF protections (e.g., SameSite cookies or CSRF tokens) for stateful cookies.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- cookie-parser

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit test registration endpoint: verify hashed password, status codes for missing fields and duplicates
- Unit test login endpoint: correct and incorrect credentials yield proper status codes
- Integration test protected route: valid token grants access, missing/expired token is denied
- Penetration test to ensure no plaintext passwords are ever returned or logged

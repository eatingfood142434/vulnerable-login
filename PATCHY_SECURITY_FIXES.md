## Applied Fixes

### 1. server.js
- **Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Breaking Changes:** Yes


## Implementation Notes

### server.js
**Issue:** 1. Password hashing: Replaced plaintext storage with bcrypt.hash()/bcrypt.compare() to securely store and verify passwords.
2. JWT-based session management: Added jwt.sign() to issue tokens on login and jwt.verify() in middleware to validate tokens on protected routes.
3. Input validation: Checked for missing username/password and duplicate registrations.
4. Role enforcement: Introduced authorizeRole() middleware to restrict endpoints (e.g., admin-only delete).

**Security Notes:** â€¢ Move the in-memory users[] to a secure database with prepared queries.
â€¢ Rotate JWT secrets regularly and enforce short expiration times.
â€¢ Use HTTPS to protect tokens in transit.
â€¢ Implement account lockout/brute-force throttling on repeated login failures.
â€¢ Sanitize any additional user inputs to prevent injection in other parts of the app.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit-test registration and login flows with correct/incorrect credentials.
- Verify that hashed password differs from plaintext.
- Test token issuance, expiration, and tampering.
- Ensure protected endpoints reject requests without or with invalid tokens.
- Verify role-based access control for admin endpoints.

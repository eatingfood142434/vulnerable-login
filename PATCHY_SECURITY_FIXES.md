## Applied Fixes

### 1. server.js
- **Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Breaking Changes:** Yes


## Implementation Notes

### server.js
**Issue:** 1. Added bcrypt to store and compare password hashes instead of plaintext. 2. Introduced JWT for stateless session management: tokens signed with a secret and 1h expiry. 3. Used express-rate-limit on /login to throttle repeated attempts. 4. Input validation on username/password types. 5. Centralized error messages to avoid leaking user enumeration info.

**Security Notes:** - Store JWT_SECRET and BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS in environment variables or a secrets manager.  
- Use HTTPS in production to protect tokens in transit.  
- Consider token revocation strategy (blacklist) for logout.  
- Persist user data in a secure database, not in-memory.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- express-rate-limit

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit test login endpoint with valid and invalid credentials
- Verify rate limiting triggers after max attempts
- Test JWT lifecycle: issuance, expiry, invalid token handling
- Check that passwords are never stored or logged in plaintext

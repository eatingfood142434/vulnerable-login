## Summary
- **Total Fixes Applied:** 1/1

## Applied Fixes

### 1. server.js
- **Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Breaking Changes:** No


## Implementation Notes

### server.js
**Issue:** 1. Switched from string concatenation to a parameterized query (using '?' placeholders and a params array) to eliminate SQL injection risk. 2. Migrated to mysql2 pool.execute() which supports prepared statements by default. 3. Added input validation to enforce that username and password are strings and within an expected length. 4. Moved sensitive database configuration values into environment variables.

**Security Notes:** - Always use parameterized queries or an ORM to avoid SQL injection.  
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs, enforcing type, length, and format.  
- In production, store and compare hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt); never store plaintext passwords.  
- Limit connection pool size and use least-privileged database credentials.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- mysql2

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit test login with valid and invalid credentials
- Penetration test to confirm SQL injection is no longer possible
- Verify error handling for database outages

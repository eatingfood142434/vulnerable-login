## Applied Fixes

### 1. server.js
- **Vulnerability:** SESSION_MANAGEMENT_FLAW
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Breaking Changes:** No


## Implementation Notes

### server.js
**Issue:** 1. Added dotenv for configuration management: secrets (JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD) are loaded from environment variables, preventing hard-coded credentials.  
2. Introduced bcrypt: ADMIN_PASSWORD is hashed at initialization (salt rounds=10) to avoid plaintext storage and comparison.  
3. Input validation ensures username and password are strings, mitigating malformed requests.  
4. Replaced plaintext password check with bcrypt.compare for secure hash verification.  
5. Issued JWT tokens (signed with JWT_SECRET, 1h expiry) instead of server-side sessions to standardize stateless authentication.  
6. Set the JWT in an HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookie to prevent XSS/CSRF attacks and ensure transmission only over HTTPS.  
7. Added logout endpoint to clear the cookie, and a sample protected route (/profile) that verifies and decodes the JWT.

**Security Notes:** - Ensure HTTPS is enabled in production to enforce Secure cookies.  
- Store JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD in a secure vault or environment variables (not in source control).  
- Consider rotating JWT_SECRET and implementing token blacklisting for logout or compromise scenarios.  
- For multi-user systems, move user data to a secure database with hashed passwords and avoid pre-hashing on startup.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- cookie-parser

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Verify login with valid credentials sets auth_token cookie with HttpOnly and Secure flags.
- Attempt login with invalid credentials and confirm 401 response.
- Access protected endpoint without cookie and expect 401.
- Access protected endpoint with expired or tampered JWT and confirm rejection.
- Verify logout endpoint clears the auth_token cookie.
- Test application under HTTPS to ensure Secure cookie delivery.

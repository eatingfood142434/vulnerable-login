## Applied Fixes

### 1. server.js
- **Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Breaking Changes:** No


## Implementation Notes

### server.js
**Issue:** 1. Imported mysql2/promise and created a connection pool using environment variables to avoid hardcoded credentials. 2. Validated input types for username and password to ensure strings are received. 3. Replaced string concatenation with a parameterized query (using '?' placeholder) to prevent SQL injection. 4. Retrieved the stored password hash (column named password_hash) and used bcrypt.compare() to safely validate credentials. 5. Standardized error messages to avoid information leakage. 6. Added generic error handling for database failures.

**Security Notes:** - Ensure passwords in the database are stored as bcrypt hashes (e.g., via bcrypt.hash during user registration).
- Use HTTPS in production to protect credentials in transit.
- Implement rate limiting on the login endpoint to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- After successful login, issue a secure session cookie or JWT with appropriate expiration and signing.
- Consider adding support for account lockout after multiple failed attempts.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- mysql2
- dotenv
- bcrypt

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection payloads in username field to verify they are neutralized.
- Verify valid and invalid login attempts return correct status codes (200 for success, 401 for failure).
- Test with non-string input types to ensure 400 Bad Request is returned.
- Simulate database errors to confirm 500 Internal Server Error is handled gracefully.

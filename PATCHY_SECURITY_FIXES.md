## Applied Fixes

### 1. server.js
- **Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Breaking Changes:** No


## Implementation Notes

### server.js
**Issue:** 1. Switched to a connection pool (`mysql.createPool`) to manage connections reliably and avoid exhausting database connections.
2. Added `dotenv` to load DB credentials from environment variables instead of hardcoding.
3. Inserted basic input validation: ensured `username` and `password` are non-empty strings to block obviously invalid inputs.
4. Replaced string concatenation with a parameterized SQL query (`?` placeholders). The `params` array safely binds user input, eliminating risk of SQL injection.
5. Sanitized error responses: generic 500 for database errors, 401 for authentication failures, and 400 for bad inputâ€”avoids leaking internal details.
6. Preserved original login functionality: validating credentials, returning user object on success, error codes on failure.

**Security Notes:** * Always store passwords hashed (e.g., bcrypt) rather than plaintext. On login, compare hashed password with `bcrypt.compare()`.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
* Issue HTTP-only, secure cookies or JWTs for session management; avoid exposing tokens in response bodies.
* Ensure HTTPS is enforced to protect credentials in transit.
* Monitor and log failed login attempts for anomaly detection.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- dotenv

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt login with a known valid accountâ€”should succeed.
- Attempt typical SQL injection payloads (e.g. `username: "' OR 1=1 --"`)â€”should be rejected with 401.
- Send invalid payloads (missing fields, numeric types) to verify 400 responses.
- Simulate database errors (e.g. wrong credentials in .env) to verify 500 error handling.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. server.js
- **Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION
- **Confidence:** HIGH
- **Breaking Changes:** Yes


## Implementation Notes

### server.js
**Issue:** 1. Removed direct string interpolation in SQL and replaced with parameterized queries using mysql2's execute method, preventing SQL injection.
2. Moved database credentials and JWT secret to environment variables loaded via dotenv to avoid hardcoded plaintext credentials.
3. Introduced bcrypt to compare provided password against stored password hashes instead of plaintext comparison.
4. Implemented JWT-based stateless authentication: upon successful login, server issues a signed JWT; protected routes validate and parse the JWT from Authorization header.
5. Split responsibilities: login endpoint checks credentials; profile endpoint verifies JWT and then fetches user data via a parameterized query.

**Security Notes:** - Ensure that the users table has a column `password_hash` storing bcrypt hashes of user passwords.
- Use strong salt rounds for bcrypt (default 10+), and never log sensitive information.
- Secure environment variables in deployment, do not commit .env to source control.
- Rotate JWT_SECRET regularly and set short token expiration times.
- For production, consider HTTPS enforcement to protect tokens and credentials in transit.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- mysql2/promise

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit test login endpoint with valid and invalid credentials
- Integration test protected endpoint rejects missing/invalid tokens and accepts valid token
- Penetration-test for SQL injection attempts in username and password fields
- Verify that plaintext passwords cannot be retrieved from the database logs or API responses

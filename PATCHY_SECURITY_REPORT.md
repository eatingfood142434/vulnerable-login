## 🚨 Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (1)

#### 1. server.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Handles authentication with plaintext password storage, missing password hashing and session/JWT issuance, lacks proper authorization and role enforcement


### Medium Risk Files (0)


### Low Risk Files (0)


## 🔧 Security Fixes Provided


### 1. server.js
**Vulnerability:** AUTHENTICATION_BYPASS  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** Yes

**Explanation:** 1. Password hashing: Replaced plaintext storage with bcrypt.hash()/bcrypt.compare() to securely store and verify passwords.
2. JWT-based session management: Added jwt.sign() to issue tokens on login and jwt.verify() in middleware to validate tokens on protected routes.
3. Input validation: Checked for missing username/password and duplicate registrations.
4. Role enforcement: Introduced authorizeRole() middleware to restrict endpoints (e.g., admin-only delete).

**Security Notes:** • Move the in-memory users[] to a secure database with prepared queries.
• Rotate JWT secrets regularly and enforce short expiration times.
• Use HTTPS to protect tokens in transit.
• Implement account lockout/brute-force throttling on repeated login failures.
• Sanitize any additional user inputs to prevent injection in other parts of the app.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- dotenv
- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Unit-test registration and login flows with correct/incorrect credentials.
- Verify that hashed password differs from plaintext.
- Test token issuance, expiration, and tampering.
- Ensure protected endpoints reject requests without or with invalid tokens.
- Verify role-based access control for admin endpoints.

## 📋 Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14+
- Install dependencies: npm install express body-parser bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv

### Deployment Steps

1. **Add or update .env file with JWT_SECRET**
   - Command: `echo "JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>" >> .env`
   - Verification: Check .env contains JWT_SECRET

2. **Install new dependencies**
   - Command: `npm install bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv`
   - Verification: Ensure node_modules contains bcrypt and jsonwebtoken

3. **Deploy updated server.js to environment**
   - Command: `pm2 restart server or systemctl restart your-service`
   - Verification: Server logs show "Server running on port" and no startup errors

4. **Run automated tests**
   - Command: `undefined`
   - Verification: All auth-related tests pass


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor authentication failure rates and lock out suspicious IPs.
- Track JWT verification errors for token misuse.
- Set up alerts for high volume of 4xx responses on auth endpoints.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review each security issue carefully** - Understand the vulnerability and proposed fix
2. **Test the fixes in a development environment** - Ensure functionality is preserved
3. **Apply fixes in priority order** - Start with high-confidence, high-impact fixes
4. **Update dependencies** - Install any additional required packages
5. **Run security tests** - Verify vulnerabilities are resolved
6. **Deploy to production** - Follow your standard deployment process
7. **Monitor for issues** - Watch logs and metrics after deployment

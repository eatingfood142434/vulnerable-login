## 🚨 Vulnerability Summary

### High Risk Files (1)

#### 1. server.js (JavaScript)
- **Path:** `server.js`
- **Type:** API
- **Risk:** Contains a vulnerable login endpoint using unsanitized user input in SQL query leading to SQL injection


### Medium Risk Files (0)


### Low Risk Files (0)


## 🔧 Security Fixes Provided


### 1. server.js
**Vulnerability:** SQL_INJECTION  
**Confidence:** HIGH  
**Breaking Changes:** No

**Explanation:** 1. Imported mysql2/promise and created a connection pool using environment variables to avoid hardcoded credentials. 2. Validated input types for username and password to ensure strings are received. 3. Replaced string concatenation with a parameterized query (using '?' placeholder) to prevent SQL injection. 4. Retrieved the stored password hash (column named password_hash) and used bcrypt.compare() to safely validate credentials. 5. Standardized error messages to avoid information leakage. 6. Added generic error handling for database failures.

**Security Notes:** - Ensure passwords in the database are stored as bcrypt hashes (e.g., via bcrypt.hash during user registration).
- Use HTTPS in production to protect credentials in transit.
- Implement rate limiting on the login endpoint to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- After successful login, issue a secure session cookie or JWT with appropriate expiration and signing.
- Consider adding support for account lockout after multiple failed attempts.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- mysql2
- dotenv
- bcrypt

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Attempt SQL injection payloads in username field to verify they are neutralized.
- Verify valid and invalid login attempts return correct status codes (200 for success, 401 for failure).
- Test with non-string input types to ensure 400 Bad Request is returned.
- Simulate database errors to confirm 500 Internal Server Error is handled gracefully.

## 📋 Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Install new dependencies: npm install mysql2 dotenv bcrypt
- Ensure .env file is configured with database credentials

### Deployment Steps

1. **Add/Update .env with DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, PORT**
   - Command: `undefined`
   - Verification: Ensure process.env variables are loaded on server startup.

2. **Install new dependencies via npm**
   - Command: `npm install mysql2 dotenv bcrypt`
   - Verification: Check package.json and node_modules for new packages.

3. **Deploy updated server.js file**
   - Command: `undefined`
   - Verification: Start server and verify no startup errors in logs.

4. **Run authentication tests**
   - Command: `undefined`
   - Verification: All login tests (successful, failed, injection) pass.


### Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor authentication endpoint response time and error rates.
- Set up alerts for repeated 401 responses indicating possible brute-force attempts.
- Log database query errors and monitor for unexpected failures.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review each security issue carefully** - Understand the vulnerability and proposed fix
2. **Test the fixes in a development environment** - Ensure functionality is preserved
3. **Apply fixes in priority order** - Start with high-confidence, high-impact fixes
4. **Update dependencies** - Install any additional required packages
5. **Run security tests** - Verify vulnerabilities are resolved
6. **Deploy to production** - Follow your standard deployment process
7. **Monitor for issues** - Watch logs and metrics after deployment
